# minimal player with event bus  module

remain to complete:

  - build for web browser

  - subclasses of events and some verification technique of the
    event payload

  - add event subscriber priorites

  - player: parse manifest and extract initial segment

note: this uses the minimal ts-node/jest boilerplate node-typescript-jest-boilerplate
